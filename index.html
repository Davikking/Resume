        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am a recent graduate from RPI, one of the top engineering schools in the country. I have a decent amount of coding experience but have never dabbled in web development.
            My professional experience is in Embedded Systems for robotics. During my time with the company below, I worked on creating the systems in which the robots functioned. 
            This required extensive knowledge of embedded systems and motion controllers, as well as assembly-level code.
