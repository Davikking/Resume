        <p>
            I addition to being a software devopler I also love to do alot of different things. I am an avid video game player
            as well as a chef, painter, and all aroud artist. Some of my games are kindgdoms of amalure the reckoning, elden ring,
            Mortal Kombat, Starwars kinghts of the old republic and Cyberpunk. In addition to video games, I love board games.
            My favorite thing to do is play and paint warhammer models some of which are shown here. If you are here thenks for
